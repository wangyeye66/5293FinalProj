# Proposal Descriptions

## About Dataset

**Data:** The data I am going to use in my final project is called **Online Retail Data Set** from UCI ML repo. Here's the link for the dataset: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail>

**Source:** Dr Daqing Chen, Director: Public Analytics group. chend '\@' lsbu.ac.uk, School of Engineering, London South Bank University, London SE1 0AA, UK.

**Information:** This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

## Modeling Goal

Through this project, I would like to learn how sales will differ based on date, time, unit price and country. Then construct a *Decision Tree* and a *Logistic Regression* to predict the sales based on the information we have.

## Methods

1.  K-means for clustering
2.  Decision trees
3.  Logistic regression
